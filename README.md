# Juventus

A very basic web page about thr Juventus Football Club.

## Objective

This was a challenge given to me on day 2 of the Futureproof Bootcamp (Auguste cohort).

The focus of the site was to:

- create a website about a sport team containing a table (in approximately 1.5 hours).
- use git
- deploy on netlify

## Technologies

- HTML and CSS
- git
- gitHub
- Netlify

## Implementation

As this was a very simple page to learn how to add and style a table in HTML/CSS, I only used one html file, one CSS stylesheet and no particular technologies were used.
However I have:

- used git and github
- linked my netlify and github accounts
- deployed the website on Netlify
